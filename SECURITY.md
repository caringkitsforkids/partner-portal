## Reporting a Vulnerability

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report them using GitHub's private vulnerability reporting feature.

[Private vulnerability reporting](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/guidance-on-reporting-and-writing/privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability) makes it easy for security researchers to report vulnerabilities directly to repository maintainers using a simple form.

When reporting a vulnerability please include as much information as you can to help us better understand the possible issue.

You should receive a response within 48 hours. If for some reason you do not, please follow up via email to ensure we received your original message. Send an email to [hello@caringkitsforkids.org.uk](mailto:hello@caringkitsforkids.org.uk) and mention you reported a vulnerability through GitHub. **Please do not** include details of the vulnerability in your email.
